> Fully compatible with 1.18 and 1.16. For 1.16 you will need to edit the stone_upgrade.json since deepslate doesn't exist yet.

> Upgrading items with custom attribute data will not update values, so I highly recommend using [Item Builder](https://github.com/Zungrysoft/ItemBuilder) to change attributes, while keeping the vanilla values upgrade working. (That is, unless you don't want vanilla values and don't want it to change.)

Welcome to TransmoCrafter, a datapack that makes the smithing table a true tool for progression.

With it, armor pieces and tools can be upgraded to superior tiers using the corresponding material. It also allows transmografting, changing the shape of the item to another piece of the same type(armor or tools) and tier.

What for, you ask? That's because smithing keeps the NBT data of the first item, allowing you to shape your gear better to suit your needs, while costing materials. Using this, you have scrolls with specific ranges of gear they can be applied to. Finally you can break down any item using nether stars, which can then be applied to any type of gear.

To make it more relevant, the smithing table recipe was changed from requiring iron ingots to any stone type(cobblestone, blackstone, cobbled deepslate). The existing netherite recipes were not changed.

If you only want one feature without another, simply delete the files accordingly.

It has advancements explaining it all in-game for easier playability.

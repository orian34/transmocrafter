Welcome to TransmoCrafter, a datapack that makes the smithing table a true tool for progression.
With it, armor pieces and tools can be upgraded to superior tiers using the corresponding material. It also allows transmografting, changing the shape of the item to another piece of the same type(armor or tools) and tier.
What for you ask? That's because smithing keeps the NBT data of items, allowing you to shape your gear better to suit your needs, while costing materials.

To make it more relevant, the smithing table recipe was changed from requiring iron ingots to any stone type(cobblestone, blackstone, cobbled deepslate). The existing netherite recipes were not changed.

If you only want one feature without another, simply delete the files accordingly.

The tier upgrade tree is as such:
- Leather Armor + Chain or Block of Gold
- Chainmail Armor + Block of Iron
- Iron Armor + Block of Diamond or Turtle Shell(only for the helmet)

- Wooden Tools + Stone Materials (Smooth Stone, Polished Blackstone, Polished Deepslate)
- Stone Tools + Block of Iron or Block of Gold
- Iron Tools + Block of Diamond

Transmografting:
- Any Tier Tools + Same Tier Tools
- Any Tier Armor + Same Tier Armor

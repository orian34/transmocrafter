Welcome to TransmoCrafter, a datapack that makes the smithing table a true tool for progression.
With it, armor pieces and tools can be upgraded to superior tiers using the corresponding material. It also allows transmografting, changing the shape of the item to another piece of the same type(armor or tools) and tier.
What for you ask? That's because smithing keeps the NBT data of the first item, allowing you to shape your gear better to suit your needs, while costing materials. Using this, you have scrolls with specific ranges of gear they can be applied to. Finally you can break down any item using nether stars, which can then be applied to any type of gear(the beacon recipe was disabled).

To make it more relevant, the smithing table recipe was changed from requiring iron ingots to any stone type(cobblestone, blackstone, cobbled deepslate). The existing netherite recipes were not changed.

If you only want one feature without another, simply delete the files accordingly.

The tier upgrade tree is as such:
- Leather Armor + Chain or Block of Gold
- Chainmail Armor + Block of Iron
- Iron Armor + Block of Diamond
- Iron Helmet + Turtle Shell

- Wooden Tools + Stone Materials (Smooth Stone, Polished Blackstone, Polished Deepslate)
- Stone Tools + Block of Iron or Block of Gold
- Iron Tools + Block of Diamond
- Diamond Tools + Netherite Ingot or Heart of the Sea

Transmografting:
- Any Tier Tools + Same Tier Tools
- Any Tier Armor + Same Tier Armor
- Bow + Crossbow (vice versa)
- Shield + Iron Chestplate
- Nether Star + Any Gear

Stardust Forging:
- Any Gear + Nether Star

Inscribing:
- Flower Pattern + Armor
- Skull Pattern + Tools
- Creeper Pattern + Bow/Crossbow
- Mojang Pattern + Shield
- Piglin Pattern + Golden Armor or Tools
